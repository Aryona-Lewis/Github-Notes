# Functions of Several Variables

A **function of $f$ of two variables** is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers $(x,y)$ in a set $D$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x,y)$. The set $D$ is the **domain** of $f$ and its **range** is the set of values that $f$ takes on, that is, $$\{f(x,y) | (x,y) \in D\}$$

If a function $f$ is given by a formula and no domain is specified, then the domain of $f$ is understood to be the set of all pairs (x,y) for which the given expression defines a real number. 

## Graphs

If $f$ is a function of two variables with domain $D$, then the **graph** of $f$ is the set of all points $(x,y,z)$ in $\real^3$ such that $z=f(x,y)$ and $(x,y)$ is in $D$

The graph of  a function $f$ of two variables is a surface $S$ with equation $z=f(x,y)$

We see the graph of $S$ of $f$ as laying directly above or below its domain $D$ in the $xy$-plane

## Level and Curves and Contour Maps

> The **level curves** of a function $f$ of two variables are the curves with equations $f(x,y)=k$, where $k$ is a constant (in the range of $f$)

It is a curve in the $xy$-plane that shows where the graph of $f$ has height $k$. 

A collection of level curves is called a **contour map**

## Functions of Three or More Variables

> A **function of three variables,** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ in a domain $D\sub \real^3$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x,y,z)$
