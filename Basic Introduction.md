# Distance vs. Displacement

- Distance is the the total amount the position $(p)$ traveled
- Displacement is the *difference* in the final position $(p_i)$ and final position $(p_f)$ denoted by $$D=p_f-p_i$$

## note

1. Distance is scalar and can only have a magnitude.
2. Displacement is a vector quantity and has **both** magnitude and direction.
3. Distance is always positive, but displacement can be positive or negative.

# Speed

- Tells us how fast the distance of an object is traveling (e.g 30m/s) $$d=vt$$
Where $d$=distance, $v$=speed,  $t$=time

Alternatively, when $v$=velocity, $d$=displacement

## Difference between speed and velocity

### Speed

- Scalar
- Only Positive
- Magnitude only

### velocity

- vector quantity
- positive or negative
- magnitude and direction

## Average Speed and Average Velocity

$$average_{speed}=\frac{total \space distance}{total \space time}$$

Therefore, from the equation $d=vt$ and t-d graph, $$v=\frac{d}{t}$$

$$Average \space velocity=
\frac{total \space displacement}{total \space time}$$

These have the same formula, but different meanings. Are you tracking?

# Acceleration

$a= \frac{V_f-V_i}{t}$ Where $v$ is velocity

Whenever velocity and acceleration have *opposite* signs, the object is slowing down
